# Minesweeper
### by Vikas Adiwal

## How to Play
In order to play, the player can simply enter the x,y coordinates of the block that they would like to select, 
separated by a comma.

The numbers represent how many adjacent mines there are. The goal of the game is to find all the empty
tiles without hitting any of the mines. The number of mines is dependent upon the number of rows. 
So if there are 8 rows, then there are 8 mines in the field.
